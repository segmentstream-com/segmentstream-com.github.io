After you enter an email and click the "Invite" button, an invitation email should be sent, containing a link to the SegmentStream registeration page.
The registration page will require the user to enter his name and desired password.
Once the registration is complete, the new user can login and have full access to view and edit the project, without the 'Project Members' functionality.
