The `Viewed Cart` event must be pushed to the `digitalData.events` array when the cart page is loaded. In the event that clicking on the link to the cart does not load a new page, but opens a pop-up with the contents of the cart - you should also push the `Viewed Cart` event.

## From the site code / when using AJAX
```javascript
digitalData.events.push({
  category: 'Ecommerce',
  name: 'Viewed Cart'
});
```

## From the SegmentStream interface
**Trigger**: event `Viewed Page`

**Event handler**:
```javascript
if (_digitalData('page.type') === 'checkout') {
  return {
    category: 'Ecommerce',
    name: 'Viewed Cart'
  };
}
```
