The `Registered` event must be pushed to the `digitalData.events` array when the server responds with a message about a successful user registration.

## From the site code / when using AJAX
```javascript
digitalData.events.push({
  name: 'Registered',
  user: {
    firstName: 'Name',
    email: 'users.email@mail.ru' //required
  }
})
```

## From the SegmentStream interface
The `Registered` event can not be created from the built-in SegmentStream triggers. The event must be added from the site code.

## Required by the following integrations:
* Criteo
* Facebook
* Retail Rocket
* Driveback
* Sociomantic
