The `Logged In` event must be pushed to the `digitalData.events` array when the server responds with a message about a successful user authorization.

## From the site code
```javascript
digitalData.events.push({
  name: 'Logged In'
})
```

## When using AJAX / SPA website
```javascript
digitalData.events.push({
  name: 'Logged In',
  user: {
    firstName: 'Name',
    email: 'users.email@mail.com' //required
  }
})
```
