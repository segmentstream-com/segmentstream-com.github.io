digitalData.events.push({
  category: 'Ecommerce',
  name: 'Viewed Product Listing'
})
```


## From the SegmentStream interface
**Trigger**: event `Viewed Page`

**Event handler**:

```javascript
if (_digitalData('page.type') === 'listing') {
  return {
    category: 'Ecommerce',
    name: 'Viewed Product Listing'
  };
}
```
