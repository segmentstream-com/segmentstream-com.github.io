> Please note! Since [`version 1.1.3`](/digitaldata/standard-version), the `Added Product` event is automaticaly generated by the SegmentStream SDK library after the [`Updated Cart`](/events/updated-cart) event is triggered.

The `Added Product` event must be pushed to the `digitalData.events` array when a user adds a product to their cart or increases the quantity of a product in the cart.
>Important! The event should not be added after clicking on the "Add to Cart" button, but after the server returns a signal about the successful addition of the product to the cart.

#### From the site code / when using AJAX
```javascript
digitalData.events.push({
  name: 'Added Product',
  product: {...},
  quantity: 1
});
```
> For a detailed description of the `product` object, see the developer section.

#### From the SegmentStream interface
> If you are sure that the product will be added to the user's cart by clicking on the "Add to Cart" button, you can use the following event settings:

**Trigger**: `click`,

**CSS selector**: `.your_add_button_class,.your_increment_button_class`,

**Event handler**:

```javascript
return {
  name: 'Added Product',
  category: 'Ecommerce',
  product: _digitalData('product'),
  quantity: 1
};
```

#### Required by the following integrations:
* Facebook
* Retail Rocket
* Segmento
* Yandex.Metrica
* Google Analytics (Enhanced Ecommerce)
