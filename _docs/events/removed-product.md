> Please note! Since [`version 1.1.3`](/digitaldata/standard-version), the `Removed Product` event is automaticaly generated by the SegmentStream SDK library after the [`Updated Cart`](/events/updated-cart) event is triggered.

The `Removed Product` event must be pushed to the `digitalData.events` array when a user removes a product from their cart or decreases the quantity of a product in the cart.

#### From the site code / when using AJAX
```javascript
digitalData.events.push({
  category: 'Ecommerce',
  name: 'Removed Product',
  product: {...},
  quantity: 1
})
```
> For a detailed description of the `product` object, see the developer section.

#### From the SegmentStream interface
> The deletion of a product from the cart is a server event. We recommend pushing it to the `digitalData.events` array from the site code.

#### Required by the following integrations:
* Yandex Metrica
* Segmento
* Google Analytics
