### <a name="websiteId"></a>Website ID
------
The Website ID is a unique identifier for your online project, it can be found on the 'All Counters' page in your K50 admin panel. For information on how to create a new identifier visit the [K50 documentation page](https://help.k50.ru/tracker/calltracking/first-steps/).

### <a name="labelVariable"></a>Label variable
------
K50 allows you to pass any parameter to the counter, and use it in the tracker.

To configure the transfer of a parameter, you have to fill in 2 fields:
1. Left - Specify the data source:
 - **DigitalData**. Any variable that is present in the digitalData object
 - **Constant**. A constant value passed in the field on the right.
2. Right - Specify the name or the value of the variable in the right field.

Below are two examples of usage:
- If you have to transfer the region name, which is stored in the `website.region` digitalData variable:

- If you have to transfer the constant value `testing`:
