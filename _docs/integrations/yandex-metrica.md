### <a name="2"></a>Click map option
------
Yandex.Metrica allows you to collect information about all clicks (not just links) that visitors make on the site. There is a special report in the Metrica interface that will help you understand how your users interact with the site.
You can enable or disable the Click Map in 1 click.

The Webvisor allows not only to transmit information about clicks, but also about the movement of the user's cursor. As a result, Yandex.Metrica provides an opportunity to view videos of the users interaction with the site. You can enable or disable the Webvisor in 1 click.

[Yandex guide on the Webvisor](https://yandex.com/support/metrika/webvisor/about-webvisor.html)

### <a name="4"></a>Tracking external links option

### <a name="5"></a>Send User ID to Metrica option
------
Yandex.Metrica makes it possible to link visits to your site by the same user from different devices - into one story. To do this, you must configure the transfer of your internal client ID to the variable `digitalData.user.userId`. Enable or disable the option by clicking on the toggle switch.

### <a name="6"></a>Purchase Goal Numeric Id
By default, the integration with Yandex.Metrica includes the e-commerce module. For its correct operation, certain events (list below) must be configured, and the numerical id of the purchase goal should be set up.

The purchase goal ID is generated by Yandex.Metrica when creating a goal ("Settings"> "Goals")
1. Click on the "Add goal" button
2. Enter a name, for example "Order" or "Transaction"
3. If you use retargeting campaigns in Yandex.Direct, check the "Retargeting" box
4. Set the condition type to "JavaScript event"
5. Set the Goal ID to 'transaction' or whatever you feel like

### <a name="7"></a>Goal setup
All events that are added to the `digitalData.events` array can be passed as goals to Yandex.Metrica. To do this you need:
1. Create a new goal in the Yandex.Metrica interface. Be sure to specify the condition type: JavaScript event. Set the Goal ID
2. In the SegmentStream interface, in the left field, specify the name of the Event in `digitalData.events`, and in the right - the Goal ID in Yandex.Metrica.

### <a name="8"></a>Session parameters
If you want to build reports in Yandex.Metrica for those parameters that are not in the standard reports, you need to configure the transfer of special parameters. For example: mobile or desktop version of the site.

> It is important to distinguish the session parameters from user parameters. The session parameters are only distributed to the session during which they were transferred. If yesterday you passed the session parameter along with all hits of the user, and today you stopped passing it, this parameter will be missing in today's reports. If you passed the user parameter, this parameter will be assigned to the user (the user's browser) for all time (past and future), until the value of the user parameter is overwritten by a new value.

In order to configure the transmission of the session parameter:

1. Think of the name of the parameter by which you want to build reports in the Yandex.Metrica interface
2. Write this name in the left field of the settings for the session parameters
3. Specify the data source:
 - **DigitalData**. Any variable that is contained in the digitalData object can be passed to Yandex.Metrica as a session parameter
 - **Event**. Any variable of any event added to the `digitalData.events` array can be passed to Yandex.Metrica as a session parameter at the moment of triggering this event
 4. Specify the name of the variable in the right field

### <a name="9"></a>User parameters
If you want to send a user segment to Yandex.Metrica, for example an RFM segment or a sign that the user is subscribed to a mailing list or a sign that the user has an abandoned cart, you can set up the transmission of user parameters.
The configuration process is described in detail in [session parameters](#8)
