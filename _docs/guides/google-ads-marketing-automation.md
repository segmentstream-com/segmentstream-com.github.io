When you run ads with Google Ads, you may want to see whether clicks on your ad led a customer to take a certain action, such as a purchase on your website, calling your business, or downloading an app.

Most of the users use Google Analytics to [import conversions into Google Ads](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2375435https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2375435){:target=blank}. Alternatively, it is possible to [deploy Google Ads tracker on a website](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1722054){:target=blank} to track online conversions without Google Analytics.

Unfortunately, with both variants you are limited to default [Google Ads attribution models](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6259715){:target=blank}.

This guide explains how to use SegmentStream's or any other external attribution to automate Google Ads campaign bidding and budget allocation strategies.

## Before you begin

- You should be subscribed to SegmentStream **enterprise plan** to use this feature.
- Make sure that BigQuery is [connected to SegmentStream](/bigquery/connecting-bigquery).

## Prepare data for import

Firstly, you need to make sure that an attribution table with the following format is prepared on a daily basis inside your Google BigQuery:

Field name|Type|Mode
--- | --- | ---
date | DATE | REQUIRED
gclid | STRING | REQUIRED
external_attribution_credit | FLOAT | REQUIRED
conversion_date_time | TIMESTAMP | REQUIRED

Where:
- `date` - the date when conversion happened (good to use for partitioning);
- `gclid` - Google click identifier (is sent in a `gclid=xxxxx` format within the query string);
- `external_attribution_credit` - how much credit you attribute to the click (value from from 0 to 1);
- `conversion_date_time` - exact time of the conversion with a timezone;

> If you use SegmentSteam's AI-driven multi-touch attribution - this table will be prepared for you by the implementation team.

## Create conversion action in Google Ads
