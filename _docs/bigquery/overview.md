## What is Google BigQuery?

[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery){:target="_blank"} is Google's fully managed, petabyte scale, low cost analytics data warehouse. BigQuery is NoOps—there is no infrastructure to manage and you don't need a database administrator—so you can focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights, use familiar SQL, and take advantage of our pay-as-you-go model.

Google BigQuery is a central repository of data collected by the SegmentStream platform from one or more sources and essentially the main data warehouse where all the data will be stored. This is what commonly comes to mind you think about a relational database: structured data that fits neatly into rows and columns.
