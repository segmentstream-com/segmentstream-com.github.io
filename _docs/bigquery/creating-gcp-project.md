In this article explained how to
1. Sign up for BigQuery (with relevant links)

BigQuery is a part of Google Cloud Platform.
To use BigQuery you need to have a Google Cloud project.

## Before you begin
You should have an existing [Google Cloud Platform account](creating-gcp-account).

## Creating a Google Cloud project
1. Navigate to the [Manage resources](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager?walkthrough_id=resource-manager--create-project) page in the Google Cloud console.

2. Click **Create Project**.

3. In the **New Project** window that appears, enter a project name and select a billing account as applicable.

4. When you're finished entering new project details, click **Create**.
