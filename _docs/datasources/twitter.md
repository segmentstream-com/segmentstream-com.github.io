5. Click **Save**.

## Default source/medium

Twitter allows running ads that do not lead directly to your website (for example Twitter page promo, Twitter post promo, events promo, etc). This means that these types of campaigns can not have UTM-params and it is not possible to import them into Google Analytics due to limitations that require all imported costs to have campaign source and medium defined.

As a workaround, you can define default UTM-source and UTM-medium for your Twitter data source to see costs for these campaigns inside your Google Analytics account.
