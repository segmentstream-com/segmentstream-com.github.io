## Data import

SegmentStream can download feeds in NDJSON format and export their content into Google Big Query.

The feeds should be generated by the customer's back-end in accordance with the requirements:

- Newline Delimited JSON file format ([http://ndjson.org/](http://ndjson.org/))
- Feed must be available at a specific URL, for example: https://website/feed.txt
- Access by URL must be closed using the basic auth method.: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)

> Our system sends the date GET parameter when requesting a feed. You can use it to generate data for a specific date.
The date parameter should be of the YYYYMMDD format.

## Connecting and configuring

The process of connecting data sources is described in detail in the [overview](https://docs.segmentstream.com/datasources/index).
