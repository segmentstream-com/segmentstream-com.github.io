## Additional transformation settings

SegmentStream allows to apply additional transformations for the data and help prepare cost data reports grouped by UTM.

This might be very handy if you need to stitch cost data with website sessions or [send cost data into Google Analytics](/datadestinations/google-analytics).

To enable this transformation use **"Import cost data grouped by UTM"** setting. Once enabled, a new table with cost data grouped by UTM will appear in your data warehouse.

### Table name
