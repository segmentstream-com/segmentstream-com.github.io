## Excluding VAT

By default, Yandex.Market cost data includes VAT when you account currency is RUB. To exclude VAT from imported costs you should switch on **Exclude VAT** option and define the **VAT rate** to be excluded. You can read more about why we recommend excluding VAT [here](/datasources/#vat-handling){:target="_blank"}.

## Historical data import limits

The maximum period for which historical data is available on the Yandex.Market side is 30 days.
